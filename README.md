This project introduces a lightweight AI-powered recommendation system that helps students discover the most relevant internships based on their profile, academic background, skills, interests, and location preferences. Unlike conventional portals that overwhelm students with long lists of irrelevant opportunities, this system is built to deliver a curated selection of 3â€“5 personalized suggestions. By focusing on quality over quantity, the tool empowers students to make informed decisions about opportunities that best align with their academic qualifications, career aspirations, and eligibility.

The system has been designed with a strong emphasis on simplicity, accessibility, and inclusiveness. Recognizing that many users may not be highly digitally literate, the interface is intuitive, mobile-compatible, and easy to use. Students can upload essential details such as academic records, resumes, and certifications, while the system automatically interprets these inputs to generate relevant matches. This ensures that even those with limited technical experience can effectively engage with the platform.

At its core, the recommendation engine uses lightweight AI models such as content-based similarity scoring and ranking algorithms to compare student profiles with internship requirements. These models evaluate parameters like CGPA, department, skills, and location preference, and then assign relevance scores to available opportunities. The approach is deliberately resource-efficient, avoiding the need for complex deep learning infrastructure, which makes the solution scalable, cost-effective, and deployment-friendly.

From a technical standpoint, the backend architecture supports structured databases that securely manage student profiles, company job postings, and application records. Sensitive documents such as Aadhaar cards or resumes are handled with care through secure storage, with only file paths being recorded in the database. On retrieval, the system can parse information from these documents, such as date of birth for eligibility verification, further strengthening its practical utility.

The project also ensures seamless integration with government initiatives like the PM Internship Scheme portal by adhering to lightweight deployment practices and prioritizing interoperability. Its adaptability makes it suitable not only for large-scale use but also for smaller institutions aiming to streamline placement support.

In summary, this project bridges the gap between students and industry by offering a smart, secure, and accessible internship recommendation system. It simplifies discovery, enhances decision-making, and ensures that students are matched with opportunities that truly matter.
